;; (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent dollar dollar-per-AirMile) calculates
;;    the number of AirMiles received based on how much money spent is
;;    required for one AirMile
;; calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent: Num Nat -> Nat
;; Examples:
(check-expect (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent 70 10) 7)
(check-expect (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent 60.5 15) 4)

(define (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent dollar dollar-per-AirMile)
  (quotient (floor dollar) dollar-per-AirMile)) 

;; (calc-airmiles dollar card-type is-sponsor) produces the number of
;;    AirMiles earned for the given purchase based on the dollar
;;    amount purchased, the type of card used and if the store is a sponsor
;; calc-airmiles: Num Sym Bool -> Nat
;; requires: dollar >= 0
;; Examples:
(check-expect (calc-airmiles 70 'standard false) 3)
(check-expect (calc-airmiles 60 'premium true) 6)

(define (calc-airmiles dollar card-type is-sponsor)
  (cond [(symbol=? card-type 'standard)
         (cond [is-sponsor (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent dollar 15)]
               [else (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent dollar 20)])]
        [else
         (cond [is-sponsor (calc-airmile-per-dollar-spent dollar 10)]
